/**
 * The BFF proxy. Every /api/* request the browser makes lands here and is
 * forwarded, unopened, to the NestJS API.
 *
 * Same-origin is the whole point. Because the browser only ever talks to this
 * origin, the session cookie needs no SameSite=None, no Domain
 * attribute and no CORS entry — in development or in production — and the API
 * origin never appears in the client bundle. That includes /api/auth/*, which
 * Better Auth owns: it is proxied like everything else, so the cookie it sets
 * is a first-party cookie for this origin.
 *
 * The backend mounts a global `api` prefix and URI versioning, so a real path
 * is http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v1/brands. 127.0.0.1 rather than
 * localhost is deliberate: localhost resolves to ::1 first on Windows and Nest
 * listens on IPv4, so `localhost` here fails to connect for no visible reason.

 * variable unset, a deployed serverless function dials its own loopback,
 * nothing answers, and `fetch` throws. Next turns that into a 500 with an
 * empty body, so the storefront showed "we cannot reach the shops" while the
 * API was healthy and the only broken thing was one missing variable. There
 * was nothing in the response, the logs or the status code that named it.
 *
 * So production now refuses instead of guessing, matching resolveApiOrigin()
 * in lib/api.ts — the two disagreed, and this was the half that failed
 * quietly. Per request, not at module load, for the reason given there: a
 * throw at import time fails `next build` outright, including for the static
